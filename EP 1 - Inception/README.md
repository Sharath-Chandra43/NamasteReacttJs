 The async attribute is a boolean attribute. The script is downloaded in parallel(in the background) to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process) and don’t wait for anything.

The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.
